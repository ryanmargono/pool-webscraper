"Fri Sep 28, 2012 8:35",87254,ukdave2002,"



I thought exactly the same, so watched on line   it was dire, the director clearly unsure who his intended audience was.


What was annoying is that they really didn't show any restoration, the engine work was glossed over with the statement that ""a piston was fixed"" , the body was taken back to bare metal (not a normal bodgers technique) but we didn't see  how they tackled any of the body faults that must have been present in a 50 year old car   ok there was some tapping down of ""high's"" on the bonnet; staged for the camera, and we saw the filler applied, but was it an inch thick or just a few thou?. I suspect it was the latter as the body blokes turned out what (on the TV) looked pretty good; nice paint equal panel gaps, but the implication was that the body was ""full of filler""


Why they made a program that went out of its way to seem to promote bodging; not spent 5 quid on some metal and an hours labour on getting rid of the sunroof, why imply they were fitting secondhand, brake discs, exhaust components and shock's, why stage the phoney crash and make a big deal of surplus oil in the carbs, when they could have at least explained the original misfire...


I think it should have been called ""Carry on Restoration"" then at least we could have laughed at it!

"Fri Sep 28, 2012 10:38",87255,MikeEdwards,"I watched it last night, on a ""so bad it's good"" basis. Yes, the ""fixed a worn piston"" bit was interesting, just mentioned in passing, in fact I wonder if it was a brake piston and they just didn't mention that to make it sound more complicated. I also thought it might be a bit hard to have painted the inside of the bonnet red without removing either it or the engine, but I don't know E-types that well. I guess there's a chance the PO had done that, as it looked like he had started painting red around it.


Would you use an angle grinder with a grinding disc to remove paint on an E-type? I wouldn't. No wonder they roughed the surface of the metal up so much.


The crash bit was pathetic. An otherwise empty section of garage, strangely-voiced bloke (Alfa Romero? What's an Alfa Romero?) backs slowly into an engine that has no business being there, and it sticks a big dent in the lower quarter panel? No chance. Hard to see why it was much more than a small scrape in real life.


I have trouble believing that second-hand brake disc was going anywhere near the E-type, and I was quite surprised we got as far as the first ad break and they still hadn't bought the car.

I thought the program was marginally better than the previous week, would have been better if the staged arguments had been cut, and the time spent on the repairs! at least this show did illustrate some techniques like the guide coat for picking up minor body defects.


What I thought was interesting was the type of adverts during the breaks (assuming the online version has the same as the TV) which were for women s cloths, chocolate bars and breakfast cereal; not the sort of adverts one would expect for the average restorer ?  possibly this gives a clue to the target audience?

So I watched it and then penned this to them.


Hello


I heard about this programme from my fellow vehicle restorers in the

 UK.    It is nothing more than a fictitious piece of twaddle.


Fake arguments,  ""staged""  accident,  and an even worse staged engine

 fault that produced exhaust smoke.


Is  the discovery channel  producing a documentary  or a mediocre drama series ?


There were statements on the show that are 100% inaccurate, but they

 are so inaccurate that they had to be scripted because there are

 supposedly skilled tradespeople working on this vehicle  who would

 never utter such garbage.


Try a little internet research of the show because this poor quality

 production is not bringing your business any good reviews.

Ok I do admit to watching a clip online at work but only whilst on a really dull conference call... they stripped the bonnet with a chemical stripper and a da sander..on the basis of this alone I would watch the rest of the program...but I suspect in the rest of the program there will be less restoration and loads of staged drama!

Complete numpties.  It took a whole workshop of them to put the seat-sliders on the rails; I don't even think that was one of their fake items of jeopardy., they had just bent them with their extremely coarse handling.

I suspect that their car could probably now do with a restoration.


On second thoughts, a bit harsh, it had a nice interior and someone is going to get a few years out of it before it starts playing up.","I hope you guys on here that are restoring Fiat 500s watched last night's programme and are now reflecting on whether you should re-do any of your work to match Mawio and teams efforts.

On a brighter note I came across a series called ""Restoration Garage"" on National Geographic and it is very interesting. I mean, they take more than two weeks to restore a car, they over-run on costs, their estimates for restoration are realistic as are their time schedules but they are very interesting people and are building a Bugatti Aerolithe from just photos - and in magnesium just like the original.
